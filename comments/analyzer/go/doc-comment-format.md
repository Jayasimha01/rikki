Take a moment to read the section on doc comments in the official style guide,
[Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

The recommendations are good in general, and also help optimize your documentation for integration
with Go's tool support for documentation such as [godoc.org](http://godoc.org) and the command-line
tools [godoc and go doc](http://whipperstacker.com/2015/09/30/go-documentation-godoc-godoc-godoc-org-and-go-doc/).
