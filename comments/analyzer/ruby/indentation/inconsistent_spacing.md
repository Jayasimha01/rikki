The indentation is inconsistent which makes it harder to read and understand the code.

Human brains are incredible at detecting patterns, and tend to home right in on the places where patterns break down. This can be very useful: inconsistency will draw the eye, often alerting you to a subtle problem like a bug or a syntax error.

It can be worth enforcing consistency (making like things alike, and unlike things different) in order to enable that powerful pattern matching.
