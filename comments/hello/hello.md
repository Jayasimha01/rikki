Usually the next step is to have a conversation about your code and iterate on your solution.

In the case of _hello world_, however, we won't be encouraging conversations and iterations. We simply wanted to make sure you got through the (sometimes fiddly) process of fetching, running some tests, and submitting a solution to the site.

The next step is to fetch the next exercise (`exercism fetch`), create a solution, and then submit it to the website as a conversation starter.

Happy hacking!
